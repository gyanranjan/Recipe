Add the black pepper powder and mix well. Pour in the 3rd extract of coconut milk and let it simmer for a while.
Add the 2nd extract of coconut milk, mix well, cover, and let it simmer until the chicken and vegetables are cooked.
Once cooked thoroughly, add the 1st extract of coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and add salt. Mix well.
